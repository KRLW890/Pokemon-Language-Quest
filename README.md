# Pokemon-Language-Quest

I present the ultimate GTS challenge: the Language Dex. Not just registering every Pokemon in the Pokedex, but doing it in all nine languages.

This tool is designed to help keep track of the languages you've registered so that you don't have to refer back to the in-app Pokedex all the time.
